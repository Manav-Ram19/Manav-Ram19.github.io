In C++ the difference between this code block
```
for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
  cout<<i<<endl;
}
```
and this code block
```
int i=0;
do {
  cout<<i<<endl;
  i++;
 } while(i<5);
```
is that if instead of `int i=0`, we started out with `int i=5`, then the first code block would not output anything, whereas the second code block would output `5`.
